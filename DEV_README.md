# Airship React Native development

The example is set up to reference the module using a yarn workspace.

1) Install yarn and watchman, if necessary

```
brew install yarn
```

```
brew install watchman
```

2) Install modules

Execute the following command in the root directory

```
yarn install
```

3) Perform platform-specific setup

## iOS

1) Run `pod install` in `example/ios`

2) Open the `example/ios/AirshipSample.xcworkspace` Project

3) Create the `AirshipConfig.plist` file

4) Start the webserver in the top-level directory by running `yarn start`

5) Build and run the sample in the `example` directory: `yarn run:ios`

You should now be able to modify the iOS plugin source
directly in the sample's workspace.

## Android

1) Open `example/android` in Android Studio

2) Create the `airshipconfig.properties` file in `example/android/app/src/main/assets`

3) If using FCM, add your `google-services.json` file in `example/android/app`

4) Start the webserver in the top-level directory by running `yarn start`

5) Build and run the sample in the `example` directory: `yarn run:android`

You should now be able to modify the Android plugin source directly in Android Studio.


4) JS unit tests

We have unit tests for the Javascript part of the module. To run the tests, execute the following command in the root directory:

```
yarn test
```
