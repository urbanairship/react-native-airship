*Last Updated: June 30, 2025*

Airship adheres to the [React Native Support Policy](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/blob/main/docs/support.md)
and will support at least two major React Native versions at any given time.

Not every React Native version update will require a new major release of Airship. In some cases, multiple major versions
of Airship may support the same React Native version. When a new major version of Airship is released for an already-supported
React Native version, the previous version will enter [End of Cycle](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/blob/main/docs/support.md#what-level-of-support-can-be-expected)
status.
