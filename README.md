### Issues

Please visit https://support.urbanairship.com/ for any issues integrating or using this module.

### Requirements:
 - Xcode 10+
 - iOS: Urban Airship SDK 10+
 - React Native >= 0.44.0
 - React Native cli >= 2.0.1

## iOS Installation

The react plugin is unable to package the Urban Airship iOS SDK, therefore it must be installed as a separate step. When updating the plugin, update the SDK as well.

1) Install and link the module:

```
react-native install urbanairship-react-native
react-native link urbanairship-react-native
```

2) Install AirshipKit by following [installation guide](https://docs.urbanairship.com/platform/ios/#sdk-installation).
The react module will do its best to find the `AirshipKit` path, but if it's unable to find it for your project due to a
non-standard install path or manual installation, you can set `AIRSHIP_SEARCH_PATH` variable with the
location of the framework.

3) Add the following capabilities for your application target:
  - Push Notification
  - Background Modes > Remote Notifications

4) Create a plist `AirshipConfig.plist` and include it in your applicationâ€™s target:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>developmentAppKey</key>
  <string>Your Development App Key</string>
  <key>developmentAppSecret</key>
  <string>Your Development App Secret</string>
  <key>productionAppKey</key>
  <string>Your Production App Key</string>
  <key>productionAppSecret</key>
  <string>Your Production App Secret</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

5) Optional. In order to take advantage of iOS 10 notification attachments, such as images, animated gifs, and
video, you will need to create a notification service extension by following the [iOS Notification Service Extension Guide](https://docs.urbanairship.com/platform/reference/ios-extension/)


## Android Installation

1) Install and link the module:
```
react-native install urbanairship-react-native
react-native link urbanairship-react-native
```

2) Create the `airshipconfig.properties` file in the application's `main/assets`:
```
developmentAppKey = Your Development App Key
developmentAppSecret = Your Development App Secret

productionAppKey = Your Production App Key
productionAppSecret = Your Production Secret

# Notification customization
notificationIcon = ic_notification
notificationAccentColor = #ff0000
```

## Android FCM Setup

Adding FCM to your react-native project can be accomplished with the following steps:

1) Add the google-services gradle plugin dependency to the `build.gradle` file in project root directory:

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        google()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.1'
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.1'
    }
}
```

2) Apply the google-services plugin *at the end* of the `build.gradle` file in the `app/` directory. The plugin directive specifically needs to be included at
the *end* of the `build.gradle` file to prevent potential dependency collisions. For more information, see the [plugin documentation](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin).

```
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

3) Download your `google-services.json` file. This can be accomplished by following [`google-services.json` help documentation](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592):

4) Add the downloaded `google-service.json` file to the `app/` directory of your project. For more information
on adding the configuration file please see the [google services plugin guide](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin#adding_the_json_file )


## Enabling Notifications

Notifications by default are disabled to avoid prompting the user for permissions
at an inopportune time. For testing purposes, you probably want to enable Notifications
immediately to verify push is working:

 *Note: Push notifications are not supported on iOS simulators.*

```
import {
  UrbanAirship,
  UACustomEvent,
} from 'urbanairship-react-native'

...

export default class Sample extends Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    UrbanAirship.setUserNotificationsEnabled(true);
  }

  ...
}
```
